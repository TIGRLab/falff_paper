# falff_paper
This repository contains the scripts that were utilized in the fALFF manuscript using the SPINS and SPIN-ASD data by Bagheri et al.
Codes were run after preprocessing and cleaning as such: 
ciftify_falff.py > fALFF_normalization.sh > SPINS_SPASD_Final_ComBat_Code.m > compute vertices from surface.sh > PALM_scripts for main effect and interaction
